It is debatable if the .raw file format is an archive or not, originally
I referred to it's separation of data as "sections" however the file format
is more akin to an archive in the way it stores data so I consider it that.

RAW Structure:
	1. Section Records

First record's index is always 0, that is a good way of identifying a
this archive. If you notice the first 4 bytes of what seems to be .raw
archive is not 0 then it may not be .raw or is compressed still.

	2. Data

Raw data that is stored, with the Section Records pointing to places
in here.
